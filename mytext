The Guardian is editorially independent. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by
billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion.
This is important because it enables us to give a voice to the voiceless, challenge the powerful and
hold them to account. We keep our factual, honest reporting open to all, not just for those who can
afford it. And we want to keep it that way, for generations to come.
